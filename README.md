# Growlr

This boilerplate was built in the CraftQuest course of the same name. It is a minimal stack for local development that leverages modern tooling, like Vite 6 and Tailwind 4.

## How to Use

The best case is that you build up your own boilerplate while following the course, so you know how each part functions. However, if you decide you would like to just forgo the learning and copy what's here, you'll need to do the following:

1. Copy the files and directories from this download to a new project directory.
2. Rename the name of the DDEV project in `.ddev/config.yaml`
3. Run `ddev start` to kick off the local project.
4. Run `ddev npm install` to install of the packages for the buildchain (Vite, Tailwind, and other plugins).
5. Run `ddev composer install` to install all of the packages required to run Craft CMS.
6. Follow the Craft CMS installation instructions.
